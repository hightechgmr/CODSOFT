                              I’m Harshit Pathak, a student currently pursuing my Bachelor’s in Computer Applications (BCA) at Amrapali University, formerly known as the Amrapali Group of Institutes. My academic path has been one of steady growth and determination — completing my 10th grade with 75% during the challenging COVID batch, followed by securing over 90% in my 12th under the Uttarakhand Board (UBSE).
                              <br>
                              From the classroom to the computer lab, I have always valued learning as a continuous process — exploring concepts deeply, asking questions, and connecting theory with real-world applications. This mindset has helped me navigate my education with a focus on both understanding and applying knowledge.

                    <p class="abtext">
                         Outside the academic sphere, my curiosity has always been my strongest trait. My name, Harshit Pathak, literally translates to “Cheerful Scholar” — and in many ways, it perfectly reflects who I am. From a young age, I was fascinated by science — especially astronomy, cosmology, and the mysteries of the universe. Equally, I was drawn to computers and anything that worked with logic.
                         <br>
                         As a child, I wasn’t satisfied with just playing with toys; I wanted to understand how they worked. Building blocks intrigued me, but so did dismantling motor cars or toy guns just to see the mechanisms inside. That same hands-on curiosity also fuels my passion for gaming and game development. I’ve always loved exploring immersive virtual worlds, but even more, I enjoy learning how those worlds are built — the art, the code, and the logic that make them come alive.
                         <br>
                         This mix of wonder for the universe, fascination for technology, and creativity in gaming has shaped how I approach learning and problem-solving — with a blend of imagination, analysis, and the drive to explore what lies beneath the surface.
