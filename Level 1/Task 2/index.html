               <p>
                    Hi, I'm Harshit Pathak — a curious and creative developer with a passion for web design and game development. I enjoy transforming ideas into clean, functional digital experiences that are both engaging and efficient.
                    <br>
                    With a solid foundation in HTML and CSS, and a growing interest in modern frameworks and tools, I'm constantly experimenting — whether it's designing portfolios, building interactive interfaces, or prototyping game logic.
                    <br>
                    I thrive on learning, collaborating, and pushing creative boundaries. Every project is an opportunity to improve, explore, and bring something unique to life.

               <hr class="blue-line">
               <p>
                    When I’m not coding or designing, I’m usually diving into stories, visuals, and experiences that inspire me. Whether it’s through movies, video games, or just exploring new ideas, I love observing how creativity and emotion come together.
                    <br>
                    I’ve always been drawn to interactive worlds — how they’re built, how they feel, and how they connect with people. That’s a big reason why I enjoy game development and designing user experiences that are not just functional, but memorable.
                    <br>
                    For me, inspiration can come from anywhere — a cinematic scene, a great game mechanic, or even a simple conversation. I believe great digital experiences start with good stories, and I’m excited to keep learning how to build those, one project at a time.
